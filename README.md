# Steps to generate a Windows executable from a PyQt6 app

1. First, create a GitHub repository:

```bash
# Initialize git in your project folder
git init
# Create a .gitignore file
echo "dist/\nbuild/\n*.spec\n__pycache__/\n.DS_Store" > .gitignore
```

2. Create the GitHub Actions workflow directory and file:

```bash
# Create the directories
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

3. Create `.github/workflows/build.yml` with this content:

```yaml
name: Build Windows Executable

on: [push]

jobs:
  build-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pyinstaller PyQt6

      - name: Build executable
        run: pyinstaller --onefile --windowed hello_world.py

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: HelloWorld-Windows
          path: dist/*.exe
```

4. Push to GitHub:

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub first, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Hello World PyQt app"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

After pushing:

1. Go to your GitHub repository in the browser
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. You'll see your workflow running
4. Once completed, click on the workflow run
5. Under "Artifacts", you'll find "HelloWorld-Windows"
6. Download this artifact - it contains your Windows executable

Some pro tips:

- You can trigger builds only on specific events by modifying the `on:` section in the workflow file
- You can add a requirements.txt file for better dependency management:
  ```yaml
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- You can specify a version number in the artifact name:
  ```yaml
  name: HelloWorld-Windows-v1.0
  ```

Would you like me to help with any specific part of this process or explain how to handle additional requirements like icons or extra files?
